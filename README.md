# Concepts
This README is a list of GitHub concepts I hope to one day direct or develop.

## Licensing
I do not intend for Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal to be the license for all of these concepts, and most likely will change if I ever create these concepts into real projects. For now, CC0-1.0 is only for licensing this repository.

## List of Concepts
A checkmark represents a concept I am planning or working on.
- [ ] exfetch\
A minimalistic system fetch tool. (The name is a reference to [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) and [Undertale](https://undertale.com)'s Mettaton EX/NEO battle.)
- [ ] ohmyfetch\
Another system fetch tool. Designed to be a do-it-yourself fetch tool, customizable to a user's desires.

## Legal (kinda...not really)
If you are creating one or more of these concepts from ideation of this list, please be sure to credit me for the idea. Although, I know I have no control over credit given, I highly appreciate credit for the concepts I come up with.
